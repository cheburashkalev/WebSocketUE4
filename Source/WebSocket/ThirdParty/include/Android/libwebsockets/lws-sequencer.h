 *
 *  - outlive a single connection lifetime,
 *  - are not associated with a particular protocol,
 *  - are not associated with a particular vhost,
 *  - must receive and issue events inside the event loop
 *
 * lws_sequencer-s are bound to a pt (per-thread) which for the default case of
 * one service thread is the same as binding to an lws_context.

 * provides a way to deal with the case the step neither completed nor failed
 * within the timeout period.

 * in one transaction.  Wsi timeouts also enforce closure of the wsi when they
 * trigger, sequencer timeouts have no side effect except to queue the
 * LWSSEQ_TIMED_OUT message and leave it to the sequencer to decide how to
